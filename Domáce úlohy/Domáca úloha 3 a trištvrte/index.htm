              <strong>Bolin</strong> is an earthbender from a multicultural
              family. He grew up on the streets of
              <a href="#">Republic City</a> under the protection of his older
              brother, <strong>Mako</strong>, after their parents were murdered
              by a firebender. Eventually, he and his brother founded a
              pro-bending team, the <strong>Fire Ferrets</strong>, that would
              later include <a href="#">Avatar Korra</a>. After the Pro-bending
              Tournament ended, Bolin joined Team Avatar in an attempt to stop
              the Equalist organization.
